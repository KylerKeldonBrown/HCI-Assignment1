            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>
                The microwave’s control panel contains a dense grid of small, similar-looking buttons with 
                unclear labels. Many buttons perform multiple functions, and the interface lacks strong 
                <strong>signifiers</strong> to guide the user. This creates a mismatch between the 
                <strong>conceptual model</strong> users expect (simple heat/reheat controls) and the 
                actual design. As a result, users often need to experiment with several buttons before 
                successfully starting the microwave.
            </p>
            <p>
                This negatively impacts <strong>learnability</strong>, since new users struggle to 
                identify which buttons correspond to basic tasks like reheating or defrosting. 
                <strong>Efficiency</strong> also suffers because users must pause, read, and test 
                various buttons instead of completing tasks quickly. Finally, <strong>safety</strong> 
                can be compromised if incorrect button presses lead to overheating food or using 
                inappropriate power levels.
            </p>
            <h3>Proposed Fix</h3>
            <p>
                Group related functions together, make frequently used buttons like <em>Start</em>, 
                <em>Reheat</em>, and <em>Defrost</em> larger and more visually distinct, and add 
                intuitive <strong>signifiers</strong> such as icons or color coding. This improves 
                the <strong>mapping</strong> between controls and expected outcomes, enhancing 
                learnability and efficiency.

            <h2>Object 2: Bathroom Faucet</h2>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/faucet.jpg" alt="Bathroom faucet handles" class="object-image">
                <figcaption>Figure 2: Confusing hot/cold water mapping.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>
                The faucet has two handles placed symmetrically, but their functions are reversed: 
                turning the right handle makes hot water flow on the left and vice versa. This breaks 
                the principle of <strong>natural mapping</strong>, where the physical layout of 
                controls should match the expected outcome. Because the handles are visually identical 
                and lack proper <strong>signifiers</strong>, users are often uncertain which direction 
                produces hot or cold water.
            </p>
            <p>
                This inconsistency reduces <strong>learnability</strong> since users’ mental models 
                (“left = hot, right = cold”) don’t match the faucet’s design. <strong>Efficiency</strong> 
                is also impacted, as users waste time testing both handles until they remember the 
                reversed mapping. <strong>Safety</strong> becomes a concern when unexpected hot water 
                flows, increasing the risk of burns.
            </p>
            <h3>Proposed Fix</h3>
            <p>
                Align each handle’s orientation with its corresponding water outlet to restore 
                <strong>natural mapping</strong>. Additionally, apply visual <strong>signifiers</strong> 
                like red and blue color coding or replace the two handles with a single-lever faucet, 
                making temperature adjustments more intuitive.

            <h2>Object 3: Office Door (Push/Pull Confusion)</h2>
            <figure>
                <img src="images/door.jpg" alt="Office door with vertical handles" class="object-image">
                <figcaption>Figure 3: No signifiers for push/pull action.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <h3>Problem</h3>
            <p>
                The office door uses identical vertical handles on both sides, but one side requires 
                pushing while the other requires pulling. Because there are no visual or physical 
                <strong>signifiers</strong> to indicate the correct action, users frequently make mistakes. 
                This design fails to provide clear <strong>affordances</strong>, forcing users to rely 
                on trial and error rather than intuitive understanding.
            </p>
            <p>
                This significantly reduces <strong>learnability</strong>, as users cannot easily 
                predict how to interact with the door. <strong>Efficiency</strong> also suffers since 
                people often attempt the wrong action first, leading to awkward delays. In emergencies, 
                poor design could affect <strong>safety</strong> by slowing evacuation when seconds 
                matter.
            </p>
            <h3>Proposed Fix</h3>
            <p>
                Add clear labels like “<strong>PUSH</strong>” and “<strong>PULL</strong>” and use 
                different handle styles: a flat plate on the push side and a vertical handle on the 
                pull side. This provides stronger <strong>signifiers</strong> and makes the 
                <strong>affordances</strong> obvious without requiring prior instructions.
